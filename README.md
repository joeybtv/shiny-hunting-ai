# shiny-hunting-ai
*WIP* A Node.js application that uses Optical Character Recognition (OPC) and Image Recognition (IR) to track a Twitch content creator's shiny Pokémon hunt(s) and detect when a shiny Pokémon has been found, both without the content creator's supervision. The content creator can view their hunt(s) data online through ReactJS.
